# Pepsico_Potato_Chip_Quality_Checker
The main aim was to develop a neural network which could differentiate between defective and non-defective chips.

## Model
I have tried to train model in two different ways.
  * One is directly using the images
  * Second my data augmentation
It could be seen that the latter gives much better results.

## Dataset Used 
* [PepsiCo Lab Potato Chips Quality](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/concaption/pepsico-lab-potato-quality-control)
